SKIMLIT & Multi-Source Content Summarization Tool

SKIMLIT is a sophisticated tool designed to classify sections of scientific abstracts using advanced deep learning models like RNN, LSTM, and bidirectional LSTM. Integrated with a content summarization tool for YouTube videos and website URLs, this project delivers a comprehensive solution for extracting and organizing valuable insights from various data sources.

Features

Scientific Abstract Classification: 
Leverages RNN, LSTM, and bidirectional LSTM models to categorize sections of scientific abstracts into Objective, Methods, Results, and Conclusions.

Multi-Source Content Summarization:
Seamlessly integrates with YouTube and website URLs to summarize content using LangChain and state-of-the-art LLM models.

Streamlit Interface: 
User-friendly and intuitive interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction and organization of summarized content.

Project Overview
SKIMLIT

Purpose:
Classify and distinguish sections of scientific abstracts.

Dataset:
Trained on the PubMed 200k RCT dataset.

Models Used:
RNN, LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM.

Output: 
Identification of key sections (Objective, Methods, Results, Conclusions) in abstracts.

Multi-Source Content Summarization

Integration: 
Combines SKIMLIT with a summarization tool that supports YouTube videos and website URLs.

Technology: 
Utilizes LangChain and LLM models for precise content summarization.

Streamlit Interface: 
Provides a simple yet powerful interface for users to input URLs and receive organized summaries.

Usage

1)Scientific Abstract Classification

Input your scientific abstract into the SKIMLIT tool.
The model will classify and highlight the different sections: Objective, Methods, Results, Conclusions.

2)Content Summarization

Input the URL of a YouTube video or website into the provided field in the Streamlit app.
The tool will generate a concise summary of the content, which is then organized and displayed in a user-friendly format.
